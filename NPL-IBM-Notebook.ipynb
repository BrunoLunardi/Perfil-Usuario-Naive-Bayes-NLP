      "Queria ser inteligente como vc em programas, muito bom o vídeo\n",
      "Parabéns mano. Conteúdo de ótima qualidade. Muito obrigado!\n",
      "Show de video.. Valeu. ✌️✌️✌️\n",
      "Otimo video!\n",
      "Muito bacana a ideia de mostrar os bastidores de forma acelerada, pois mostra que programação, como qualquer outra profissão exige convicção,  persistência, dente outros, para termos sucesso! Excelente vídeo!\n",
      "Faz um jogo com Pygame por favor !!!!!!\n",
      "Muito foda,  merecia muito mais views\n",

      "Mano... Eu nem sabia que tinha como descobrir isso\n",
      "Massa demais o vídeo, parabéns! Uma ideia bacana seria testar com o NLU do IBM Watson, pode ser que tenha melhores resultados. Valeu Sagaz!\n",
      "Mestre muito legal o vídeo, é sempre legal ver o progresso todo do desenvolvimento, ver e saber que ninguém nasceu aprendendo e observar a evolução com relação a problemática, muito legal  \\o/.\n",
      "Nota 10 pra vc meu amigo, ja assisto a um tempo mas comecei a acompanhar a poucas semanas. Abraço e sucesso 👍\n",

      "showww\n",
      "Eu aqui de cabeça baixa trabalhando e dando umas olhadas no video, ouvi \"cara que comentário enorme\" fui olhar e reconheci o comentário. haha\n",
      "Eu que fiz num vídeo antigo que descobri a pouco tempo. Ainda estou aqui, vendo e curtindo os videos. o/\n",
      "Eu achei que você iria usar o Selenium pra acessar o YouTube e o beautifulsoup pra extrair os comentários de dentro do HTML da página rs\n",
      "E o link do github? :)\n",
      "Vamo testar, dps vc fala o q deu nos meus próximos 2 coments\n",

      "gostei. botou no github??\n",
      "holly, no video foi compartilhar minha história e como os videos/ novidades que via me motivava a continuar e do nada fui o mais negativo hasuashuh. Hoje mudei para JS estou trabalhando com Reactjs e React-native mas valeu muito o que aprendi em python :D massa o video!\n",
      "Que legal\n",
      "Não achei esses códigos no seu github... coloca lá, dá pra aprender bastante\n",
      "@Programador eu queria entrar em contato com você, queria saber se tem como fazer um projeto que estou pensando, e também queria saber se seria complicado! Sei que para IA nada e impossivel, Se tiver como responder meu comentario para podermos conversarmos sobre eu agradeceria muito!\n",
      "faltou \"selenium e bs4\" resolveria seu problema de modo 'fácil\", como ?\n",
      "\n",
      "1 => acessar com selenium seu canal, ir em \"vídeos\", tem um elemento aonde lista todos os vídeos.\n",
      "2=> você entra no primeiro vídeo, lá também tem um elemento de comentários...\n",
      "3=> você tem acesso aos comentários por string e por fileira, alias acesso a todos comentários.\n",
      "4=> fazer oq vc bem entender...\n",
      "\n",
      "eu não uso API do google nem nada em minhas automações, elas são limitadas e envia muito dados sobre o que você tá fazendo, pra vc tomar um ban na sua conta do gmail é um pulo\n",
      "Fiquei pensando, seria massa apesar de não ser totalmente eficaz usar uma API do google translate para traduzir todos os comentários e depois usar o negocio de sentimento em inglês mesmo, acho que só seria eficaz se a precisão em inglês fosse muito maior do que a do menino que fez em português, apesar do translate não traduzir tudo certinho acho que o medidor analisa mais palavras chaves e não o texto por completo.\n"
